# Film Inclusivity in the Film Industry from 2000 to 2020

This project was inspired by a blog post shared by [Caroline Barret](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2018/07/gender-diversity-in-the-film-industry/) on July 25, 2018 on [R Bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/). 
Her post touched on gender diversity within the film industry, specifically looking at the gender makeup of the crew working on the films. Similar to Barret, I will be looking at gender, particularly the directors and stars and observing how the makeup has changed in the past twenty years. 

## Questions of Interest

The purpose of this project will be to showcase what I have learned in R Studio but I would also like to return valuable insights about the film industry and it's changing demographics. 
I plan to look to see if the film industry has changed in the last twenty years to become more inclusive toward women and how has movies made and starring women performed in comparison to those made by and starring men. 
Do women directors/stars trend toward a specific movie genre and what could a female led movie released in 2022 expect tro make give the same genre? 

## Plan of Action

Using the IMDB list [Top 10 Movies Each Year Since 2000](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls003454917/), I will scrape this webpage (using R) to return crucial information such as the movie name, 
year released, rating, director, stars, gross profit, Metascore, IMDB Score and genre. 

Next steps will be to take this information and format it into a CSV file and export to manually clean and organize the data for exploratory analysis. During exploratory data analysis I am hoping to find that there 
has been an increase in women led movies in the past 20 years and plan to create a forecast that will return the estimated gross profit and Metascore for movies made by women given that same genre. 

During EDA I will create several visuals that will explore the relationships between men and women directors, specific genres and how those movies have performed at the box office. 

I would like to take my forecast and create an interactive visual that will allow the user to estimate the gross profit and score for any year in the future, given this dataset. 

The project output at this time is a written report/blog post that will discuss my findings, however, if time permits, I would like to look at creating an R Markdown Webpage to share my results.
